# Schedule Management Assignment

This repository contains two implementations for the schedule management assignment, one in Java and one in Python.

## Java Implementation

The Java solution follows an object-oriented approach and includes a GUI where users can input their schedule information. Additionally, the program has the ability to load random data and display the schedule table for the week. The code is located in the `src` folder, which follows package structures and adheres to object-oriented principles.

### Features:
- GUI for user input.
- Ability to load random data.
- Displays the schedule table for the entire week.

## Python Implementation

The Python solution is located in the `assignment4.py` file. In this implementation, I have created random dummy data for the schedule and displayed it. This Python solution provides a simple way to generate and manage a schedule.

### Features:
- Generates random dummy data for the schedule.
- Displays the schedule in a structured format.

## Screenshots

Screenshots of the successful outputs from both the Java and Python implementations can be found in the `screenshots` folder.

## How to Run

- For **Java**, compile and run the `src` folder files using any Java IDE or command line.
- For **Python**, simply execute the `assignment4.py` file.

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or need further clarification on the implementation!
